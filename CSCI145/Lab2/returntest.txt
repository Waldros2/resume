The problem with the returntest.java program was the if statement.

It had 1 if();
2 else if();
0 else;

by turning the last one into an else rather than else if (), it was recognized as the last of the conditional.












In the alternate program, I recieved error message: missing return statement. We got this error because
we weren't returning any value, only assigning it to answer.
